# click-to-copy-skeleton

## Click-to-Copy
An extremely lightweight repo that provides a "click-to-copy" skeleton for when you need a large clipboard history (but more easily navigatable than the Windows 10 clipboard history). Customize what you want copied and pasted by typing your code into the text box.

Examples for when you need a large clipboard: filling out applications for summer internships. ;)
